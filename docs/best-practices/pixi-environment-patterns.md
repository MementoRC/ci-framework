# Pixi Environment Configuration Patterns

> **Revolutionary Environment Management**: Achieve development speed without sacrificing deployment confidence through intelligent environment isolation

## The Pixi Advantage

Pixi represents a paradigm shift in Python project management, combining the **speed of conda** with the **reproducibility of lockfiles** and the **simplicity of modern package managers**. This guide demonstrates proven patterns from 8 production projects.

### Core Benefits

- 🚀 **Lightning-fast installs** with conda-forge binary packages
- 🔒 **Reproducible environments** with platform-specific lockfiles  
- 🎯 **Isolated feature environments** for specialized workflows
- ⚡ **Zero virtual environment overhead** with native activation
- 🔄 **Cross-platform consistency** from development to production

## Tiered Environment Architecture

### Foundation Pattern: Solve Group Strategy

```toml
[tool.pixi.project]
name = "project-name"
channels = ["conda-forge", "pyviz"]  # conda-forge first for stability
platforms = ["linux-64", "osx-64", "osx-arm64", "win-64"]

# CRITICAL: All environments share same solve group for consistency
[tool.pixi.environments]
default = {solve-group = "default"}
quality = {features = ["quality"], solve-group = "default"}
quality-extended = {features = ["quality", "quality-extended"], solve-group = "default"}
dev = {features = ["quality", "quality-extended", "dev-tools"], solve-group = "default"}
ci = {features = ["quality", "ci-reporting"], solve-group = "default"}
```

**Why solve groups matter:**
- ✅ **Consistent dependency resolution** across all environments
- ✅ **Faster subsequent installs** with shared dependency cache
- ✅ **No version conflicts** between development and testing
- ✅ **Predictable behavior** across team members and CI

### Tier 1: Essential Dependencies (Always Available)

```toml
# Core dependencies available in ALL environments
[tool.pixi.dependencies]
python = ">=3.10,<3.13"

# Core application dependencies
requests = ">=2.28.0"
pydantic = ">=2.0.0"
typer = ">=0.9.0"

# Essential development tools (always needed)
pytest = ">=8.0.0"
```

**Philosophy**: Include dependencies that are needed in **every single environment** to minimize feature duplication.

### Tier 2: Quality Feature (Fast Development)

```toml
[tool.pixi.feature.quality.dependencies]
# Testing framework
pytest = ">=8.0.0"
pytest-cov = ">=4.0.0"
pytest-asyncio = ">=0.21.0"
pytest-timeout = ">=2.1.0"

# Code quality essentials
ruff = ">=0.1.0"  # Replaces flake8, isort, black
mypy = ">=1.0.0"

# Task definitions for quality environment
[tool.pixi.feature.quality.tasks]
test = "pytest framework/tests/ -v"
lint = "ruff check framework/ --select=F,E9"  # Critical errors only
typecheck = "mypy framework/"
quality = { depends-on = ["test", "lint", "typecheck"] }
```

**Use Case**: Development workflow, PR validation, essential CI gates

### Tier 3: Extended Quality (Comprehensive Validation)

```toml
[tool.pixi.feature.quality-extended.dependencies]
# Security scanning
bandit = ">=1.7.0"
safety = ">=2.0.0"
pip-audit = ">=2.6.0"

# Advanced code analysis
radon = ">=6.0.0"  # Complexity analysis
vulture = ">=2.7.0"  # Dead code detection

# Git hooks integration
pre-commit = ">=3.0.0"

[tool.pixi.feature.quality-extended.tasks]
security-scan = "bandit -r framework/ --severity-level high"
complexity-check = "radon cc framework/ --min B"
pre-commit-check = "pre-commit run --all-files"
```

**Use Case**: Pre-merge validation, security audits, release preparation

### Tier 4: CI Reporting (Pipeline Integration)

```toml
[tool.pixi.feature.ci-reporting.dependencies]
# CI-specific reporting
pytest-json-report = ">=1.5.0"
pytest-html = ">=4.0.0"
coverage = ">=7.0.0"

# SARIF integration
sarif-tools = ">=0.1.0"

[tool.pixi.feature.ci-reporting.tasks]
ci-test = "pytest framework/tests/ --cov=framework --cov-report=xml --json-report"
ci-lint = "ruff check framework/ --output-format=github"
```

**Use Case**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, automated reporting

### Tier 5: Specialized Development Tools

```toml
[tool.pixi.feature.dev-tools.dependencies]
# Development conveniences
ipython = ">=8.0.0"
jupyter = ">=1.0.0"
rich = ">=13.0.0"  # Better console output

# Build and distribution
build = ">=0.10.0"
twine = ">=4.0.0"

# Performance analysis
memory-profiler = ">=0.60.0"
pytest-benchmark = ">=4.0.0"

[tool.pixi.feature.dev-tools.tasks]
notebook = "jupyter lab"
profile = "python -m memory_profiler"
benchmark = "pytest --benchmark-only"
```

**Use Case**: Active development, experimentation, performance analysis

## Advanced Environment Patterns

### Multi-Platform Configuration

```toml
[tool.pixi.project]
channels = ["conda-forge"]
platforms = ["linux-64", "osx-64", "osx-arm64", "win-64"]

```

### Microservice Architecture Pattern

```toml
# Each service has its own feature
[tool.pixi.feature.api-service.dependencies]
fastapi = ">=0.100.0"
redis = ">=4.6.0"

[tool.pixi.feature.worker-service.dependencies]

worker = {features = ["quality", "shared", "worker-service"], solve-group = "default"}
full-stack = {features = ["quality", "shared", "api-service", "worker-service"], solve-group = "default"}
```

## Task Definition Patterns

### Essential Task Patterns

```toml
[tool.pixi.tasks]
# TIER 1: Essential Development Tasks (always fast)
install = "pixi install"
dev = "echo 'Development environment ready'"

# Core quality gates (< 5 minutes)
test = "pixi run -e quality test-impl"
test-impl = "pytest framework/tests/ -v --timeout=120"
lint = "pixi run -e quality lint-impl" 
lint-impl = "ruff check framework/ --select=F,E9"
typecheck = "pixi run -e quality typecheck-impl"
typecheck-impl = "mypy framework/"

# Emergency fixes
lint-fix = "ruff check --fix framework/"
format = "ruff format framework/"
emergency-fix = "pixi run lint-fix && pixi run format && pixi run test"

# Combined gates
quality = { depends-on = ["test", "lint", "typecheck"] }
```

### Advanced Task Patterns

```toml
[tool.pixi.tasks]
# TIER 2: Extended Validation
security = "pixi run -e quality-extended security-impl"
security-impl = "bandit -r framework/ && safety check"
complexity = "pixi run -e quality-extended complexity-impl" 
complexity-impl = "radon cc framework/ --min B"

# TIER 3: CI Integration
ci-test = "pixi run -e ci ci-test-impl"
ci-test-impl = "pytest framework/tests/ --cov=framework --cov-report=xml --json-report"
ci-full = { depends-on = ["quality", "security", "complexity"], env = { ENVIRONMENT = "ci" } }

# TIER 4: Development Conveniences
serve = "pixi run -e web uvicorn app.main:app --reload"
docs = "pixi run -e docs sphinx-build docs/ docs/_build/html"
notebook = "pixi run -e dev jupyter lab"

# TIER 5: Maintenance
clean = "rm -rf __pycache__ .pytest_cache .coverage .ruff_cache"
reset = { depends-on = ["clean"], cmd = "pixi install --force" }
update = "pixi update"
```

### Conditional Task Execution

```toml
[tool.pixi.tasks]
# Environment-aware tasks
test-quick = { cmd = "pytest framework/tests/unit/ -x", env = { PYTEST_TIMEOUT = "30" } }
test-full = { cmd = "pytest framework/tests/", env = { PYTEST_TIMEOUT = "300" } }

# Platform-specific tasks
[tool.pixi.target.linux-64.tasks]
benchmark-linux = "pytest --benchmark-only --benchmark-storage=linux-bench"

[tool.pixi.target.osx-64.tasks]  
benchmark-macos = "pytest --benchmark-only --benchmark-storage=macos-bench"

# Feature-dependent tasks
[tool.pixi.feature.ml.tasks]
train = "python scripts/train_model.py"
evaluate = "python scripts/evaluate_model.py"
```

## Performance Optimization Patterns

### Dependency Resolution Optimization

```toml
[tool.pixi.project]
# Optimize channel priority for faster resolution
channels = [
    "conda-forge",    # Primary: Most packages, best maintained
    "pytorch",        # Specific: Only when needed
    "pyviz",         # Specific: Only for visualization stack
]

# Pin platform list to reduce solve complexity
platforms = ["linux-64"]  # Local development
# platforms = ["linux-64", "osx-64", "osx-arm64"]  # Team development
# platforms = ["linux-64", "osx-64", "osx-arm64", "win-64"]  # Full support
```

### Lockfile Management

```bash
# Generate platform-specific lockfiles
pixi install              # Current platform only
pixi install --all-platforms  # All configured platforms

# Update strategy
pixi update package-name  # Specific package
pixi update --environment quality  # Specific environment
pixi update              # All packages (careful!)
```

### CI Optimization Patterns

```yaml
# GitHub Actions optimization
- name: Setup Pixi with Caching
  run: |
    curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
    echo "$HOME/.pixi/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH

- name: Cache Pixi Environment  
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.pixi/envs
      .pixi/envs
    key: pixi-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('pixi.lock') }}
    restore-keys: |
      pixi-${{ runner.os }}-

- name: Install Dependencies
  run: pixi install --environment quality

- name: Run Quality Gates
  run: pixi run -e quality quality
```

## Migration from Other Package Managers

### From Poetry

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Dependency Resolution Conflicts
```bash
# Symptom: "Solver failed to find a solution"
# Cause: Conflicting version requirements

# Solution: Check dependency constraints
pixi info package-name

# Relax constraints temporarily
[tool.pixi.dependencies]
package-name = "*"  # Most permissive

# Or use explicit channels
package-name = {version = ">=1.0.0", channel = "conda-forge"}
```

#### 2. Platform-Specific Issues
```bash
# Symptom: Package not available for platform
# Cause: Package not built for target platform

# Solution: Check available platforms
pixi search package-name

# Use pip fallback for missing packages
[tool.pixi.dependencies]
conda-package = ">=1.0.0"
pip-only-package = {source = "pypi", version = ">=1.0.0"}
```

#### 3. Environment Activation Issues
```bash
# Symptom: Commands not found in environment
# Cause: Environment not properly activated

# Solution: Use explicit environment commands
pixi run -e quality pytest  # Explicit environment
pixi shell -e quality       # Interactive shell
```

#### 4. Lockfile Synchronization
```bash
# Symptom: "Lock file is out of date"
# Cause: pyproject.toml changed but lockfile not updated

# Solution: Update lockfile
pixi install                # Update current platform
pixi install --all-platforms  # Update all platforms
```

### Performance Troubleshooting

#### Slow Installation
```bash
# Check solver time
pixi install --verbose

# Reduce platforms for faster solving
platforms = ["linux-64"]  # Local development only

# Use explicit channels
channels = ["conda-forge"]  # Avoid channel mixing
```

#### Large Environment Size
```bash
# Check environment size
pixi list -e environment-name

# Minimize dependencies
[tool.pixi.feature.minimal.dependencies]
package = {version = ">=1.0.0", extras = []}  # No optional dependencies
```

## Best Practices Summary

### ✅ DO

1. **Use solve groups** for environment consistency
2. **Start with minimal platforms** (linux-64 only for development)
3. **Organize by features** not by tool type
4. **Pin major versions** for stability (`>=1.0,<2`)
5. **Use tiered environments** for different use cases
6. **Leverage conda-forge** as primary channel
7. **Define clear task dependencies** with `depends-on`
8. **Cache pixi environments** in CI
9. **Use explicit environment commands** (`pixi run -e env`)
10. **Keep lockfiles in version control**

### ❌ DON'T

1. **Mix conda and pip** unnecessarily
2. **Over-constrain versions** (`==1.2.3` unless required)
3. **Create too many small environments** (prefer features)
4. **Ignore platform differences** in mixed teams
5. **Use global pixi commands** in CI (be explicit)
6. **Skip lockfile updates** after dependency changes
7. **Mix multiple solve groups** without reason
8. **Use `*` versions** in production
9. **Create circular task dependencies**
10. **Ignore channel priority** order
