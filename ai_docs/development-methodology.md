# CI Framework Development Methodology

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-07-12
**Purpose**: Session-restart resilient development methodology for CI Framework PRD implementation
**Integration**: TaskMaster AI + UCKN + CLAUDE.md

---

## üéØ **METHODOLOGY OVERVIEW: Integration-First BDD/TDD Hybrid**

### **Core Principle**
For CI/CD framework development, **integration testing is more critical than unit testing** because the framework's value comes from real-world project integration, not isolated component function.

### **3-Layer Testing Approach**
1. **BDD Layer**: User scenario acceptance criteria
2. **TDD Layer**: Component reliability through test-first development
3. **Integration Layer**: Real-world validation against target projects

---

## üîÑ **STRICT DEVELOPMENT CYCLE**

### **Per-Subtask Cycle (Mandatory Order)**
```
1. BDD Scenario Definition     ‚Üê Define acceptance criteria
2. TDD Test Implementation     ‚Üê Write failing tests first
3. Minimal Implementation      ‚Üê Code to pass tests only
4. Integration Test #1         ‚Üê Test against hb-strategy-sandbox
5. Integration Test #2         ‚Üê Test against cheap-llm or other project
6. Performance Benchmark       ‚Üê Validate speed requirements
7. Compatibility Matrix       ‚Üê Test across Python versions/platforms
8. Documentation Update       ‚Üê Maintain current documentation
9. TaskMaster Gate Validation ‚Üê ALL gates must pass before next subtask
```

### **Mandatory Gates (ALL must pass)**
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: 100% pass rate, 95%+ coverage
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Works with 2+ target projects
- [ ] **Performance**: Within 5% of baseline or shows improvement
- [ ] **Compatibility**: Python 3.10-3.12, ubuntu/macos support
- [ ] **CI Validation**: All quality gates passing in CI environment
- [ ] **Documentation**: Updated with examples and troubleshooting

## üìã **TASKMASTER INTEGRATION STRATEGY**

### **Session-Restart Resilience**
Each TaskMaster task/subtask contains **COMPLETE methodology context** so that when sessions restart, the development approach is preserved and consistent.

### **Self-Contained Task Template**

## üß† **MEMORY PERSISTENCE STRATEGY**

### **TaskMaster as Source of Truth**
- **All methodology context embedded in tasks** - survives session restarts
- **Gate requirements explicit in each subtask** - no methodology knowledge assumed
- **Target project paths included** - specific integration test directions
- **Performance baselines documented** - consistent benchmark targets

### **UCKN Integration for Pattern Persistence**
```bash
# Contribute methodology patterns to UCKN
mcp__uckn-knowledge__contribute_pattern \
  --pattern-title "CI Framework Development Methodology" \
  --pattern-type "best_practice" \
  --pattern-description "Integration-First BDD/TDD Hybrid for meta-tooling" \
  --technologies ["ci-cd", "testing", "taskmaster", "meta-tooling"]

# Search for methodology patterns when restarting sessions
mcp__uckn-knowledge__search_patterns \
  --query "ci framework development methodology" \
  --pattern-type "best_practice"
```

### **Local CLAUDE.md for Development Context**
Create `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in project root with methodology reminders:

```markdown
# CI Framework Development Context

## üîÑ METHODOLOGY REMINDER
When working on CI Framework tasks, ALWAYS follow the Integration-First BDD/TDD Hybrid methodology.

## üìã BEFORE STARTING ANY TASK:
1. Check TaskMaster for complete methodology context
2. Read the task's embedded methodology_step description
3. Follow the 9-step development cycle strictly
4. Validate ALL gates before proceeding

## üéØ KEY PRINCIPLES:
- Integration testing more critical than unit testing
- Test against real projects (hb-strategy-sandbox, cheap-llm)
- Performance benchmarking with every change
- ALL gates must pass before next subtask

## üìÇ TARGET PROJECTS for integration testing:
- Primary: /home/memento/ClaudeCode/Project/hb-strategy-sandbox/worktrees/feat-workspace-phase2
- Secondary: /home/memento/ClaudeCode/Servers/cheap-llm/worktrees/feat-phase1
- Additional: /home/memento/ClaudeCode/Servers/claude-code-knowledge-framework/worktrees/feat-task-3

## üö® CRITICAL: NO SHORTCUTS
Every subtask must complete all 9 methodology steps and pass all gates.
```

---

## üîÑ **SESSION RESTART PROCEDURE**

### **When Restarting Development Session**
1. **Read this methodology document** - `ai_docs/development-methodology.md`
2. **Check TaskMaster current task** - get complete context with embedded methodology
3. **Review local CLAUDE.md** - methodology reminders and project paths
4. **Query UCKN for patterns** - retrieve methodology patterns if contributed
5. **Validate current state** - ensure last completed subtask passed all gates
6. **Continue with strict methodology** - follow embedded task instructions

### **Context Recovery Commands**
```bash
# Get current TaskMaster state
mcp__task-master-ai__get_tasks --projectRoot="." --status="in-progress"

# Get next task with methodology context
mcp__task-master-ai__next_task --projectRoot="."

# Search UCKN for methodology patterns
mcp__uckn-knowledge__search_patterns --query="ci framework methodology"

# Read local methodology reminders
read .claude/CLAUDE.md
```

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR METHODOLOGY ADOPTION**

### **Immediate Success Indicators**
- [ ] TaskMaster tasks contain complete methodology context
- [ ] Each subtask has explicit gate requirements
- [ ] Target project paths documented in tasks
- [ ] Performance baselines established and documented

### **Ongoing Success Indicators**
- [ ] 100% gate passage rate before proceeding to next subtasks
- [ ] Zero "big bang" integration issues
- [ ] Consistent development velocity across sessions
- [ ] Real-world validation with every component

### **Long-term Success Indicators**
- [ ] Framework components production-ready upon completion
- [ ] No technical debt accumulation
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved throughout development
- [ ] Seamless integration across all target projects

---

## üö® **CRITICAL REMINDERS**

### **Never Skip Steps**
The 9-step methodology must be followed completely for every subtask. No exceptions.

### **Real Projects Are the Test**
Unit tests are necessary but not sufficient. Integration with real projects is the validation that matters.

### **Performance First**
Benchmark with every change. CI speed directly impacts developer productivity.

### **All Gates Must Pass**
Do not proceed to next subtask until ALL gates have passed. Fix issues immediately.

**This methodology ensures consistent, high-quality development that survives session restarts and maintains development velocity throughout the entire PRD implementation.**
