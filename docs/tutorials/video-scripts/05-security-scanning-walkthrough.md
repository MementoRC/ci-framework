## Video Script

### Introduction & Security Landscape (0:00-0:45)

**[Visual: News headlines about security breaches and vulnerability statistics]**

**Narrator**: "Security vulnerabilities in Python applications are discovered daily. The average Python project has 15+ security issues that traditional development workflows miss completely. What if your CI pipeline could catch these automatically, before they reach production?"

**[Visual: Framework security scanning dashboard showing comprehensive coverage]**

**Narrator**: "The CI Framework provides a multi-layered security defense system with 4 progressive security levels - from basic vulnerability detection to enterprise-grade compliance scanning. In the next 6 minutes, I'll show you how this system automatically protects your applications while providing clear remediation guidance."

**[Visual: Security scanning architecture showing multiple tools integrated]**

- Supply chain security analysis

### Live Demonstration: Basic Level Scanning (1:30-2:45)

**[Visual: Code editor showing a Python file with security vulnerabilities]**

**Narrator**: "Let me demonstrate with a realistic example. Here's code that might pass code review but contains serious security issues:"

```python
import subprocess
import os
from random import random

# Security Issue 1: Hardcoded secret
API_KEY = "sk-1234567890abcdef"  # B105: Hardcoded password

# Security Issue 2: SQL injection vulnerability  
def get_user(user_id):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"  # B608: SQL injection
    return execute_query(query)

# Security Issue 3: Shell injection
def backup_file(filename):
    subprocess.call(f"cp {filename} /backup/", shell=True)  # B602: Shell injection

# Security Issue 4: Insecure random
def generate_token():
    return int(random() * 1000000)  # B311: Insecure random
```

**[Visual: Running basic security scan]**

```bash
# Run basic security level
pixi run security-basic
```

**[Visual: Bandit scan results with clear vulnerability identification]**

**[Visual: Automated remediation in action]**

**Narrator**: "The framework doesn't just identify issues - it provides automated remediation where possible:"

```bash
pixi run security-fix-basic
```

**[Visual: Code being automatically fixed]**

```python
import subprocess
import os
from secrets import token_urlsafe

# Fixed: Use environment variable
API_KEY = os.getenv("API_KEY")  # Secure: Environment variable

# Fixed: Parameterized query  
def get_user(user_id):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"  # Secure: Parameterized
    return execute_query(query, (user_id,))

# Fixed: Secure token generation
def generate_token():
    return token_urlsafe(16)  # Secure: Cryptographically secure random
```

### Dependency Vulnerability Scanning (2:45-3:45)

**[Visual: Requirements file with vulnerable dependencies]**

**Narrator**: "Basic code scanning catches obvious issues, but what about vulnerable dependencies? Let's escalate to Standard level scanning:"

```bash
# Run standard security level (includes dependency scanning)
pixi run security-standard
```

**[Visual: Safety and pip-audit running with dependency analysis]**

```
üîç Dependency Vulnerability Scan Results:

**[Visual: Automated dependency updates]**

```bash
pixi run security-update-deps
```

**[Visual: Package manager updating dependencies safely]**

**Narrator**: "The framework automatically updates vulnerable dependencies while respecting version constraints and testing compatibility. This prevents the common problem of security patches breaking existing functionality."

### GitHub Security Integration (3:45-4:30)

**[Visual: GitHub repository Security tab]**

**Narrator**: "All security scan results are automatically integrated with GitHub's Security tab using SARIF format:"

**[Visual: GitHub Security dashboard showing vulnerability overview]**

- **Code Scanning Alerts**: 4 security issues detected by Bandit
- **Dependabot Alerts**: 3 vulnerable dependencies identified  
- **Secret Scanning**: 1 potential secret detected

**[Visual: Clicking into specific vulnerability for detailed view]**

**Narrator**: "Each vulnerability provides detailed information including:"
- **Severity and confidence levels**
- **Exact file location with code snippet**
- **Remediation guidance with code examples**
- **Links to CVE databases and security advisories**

**[Visual: Remediation workflow integration]**

**Narrator**: "GitHub's interface allows you to create issues, assign remediation tasks, and track security improvements over time - all automatically populated with framework scan data."

### Advanced Security Patterns (4:30-5:15)

**[Visual: More complex code showing business logic vulnerabilities]**

**Narrator**: "For advanced security needs, the framework includes Semgrep for detecting complex security patterns specific to your application domain:"

```python
# Business logic vulnerability - privilege escalation
def update_user_role(user_id, new_role, requesting_user):
    # Missing authorization check - Advanced security rule would catch this
    if new_role == "admin":
        # Should verify requesting_user has admin privileges
        user_service.update_role(user_id, new_role)
```

**[Visual: Advanced security scan results]**

```bash
pixi run security-advanced
```

```
üîç Semgrep Advanced Security Analysis:

‚ùå BUSINESS LOGIC VULNERABILITY:
Rule: privilege-escalation-pattern
  - File: src/user_service.py:15
  - Severity: HIGH
  - Pattern: Admin role assignment without authorization check
  - Recommendation: Add privilege verification before role updates

‚ùå FRAMEWORK-SPECIFIC ISSUE:
Rule: django-sql-injection  
  - File: src/views.py:42
  - Severity: MEDIUM
  - Pattern: Django ORM raw query with user input
  - Recommendation: Use parameterized queries or ORM methods
```

**[Visual: Custom security rules configuration]**

**Narrator**: "You can configure custom Semgrep rules specific to your application's security requirements, frameworks, and business logic patterns."

### Enterprise Compliance Scanning (5:15-6:00)

**[Visual: Enterprise compliance dashboard]**

**Narrator**: "For enterprise environments, the Critical level provides comprehensive compliance scanning:"

```bash
# Run critical security level (full enterprise scanning)
pixi run security-critical
```

**[Visual: Trivy comprehensive security analysis]**

```
üîç Enterprise Security & Compliance Analysis:

‚úÖ SOC 2 Compliance: 94% compliant (3 issues to address)
‚úÖ PCI DSS Requirements: 89% compliant (5 issues to address)
