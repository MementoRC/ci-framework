## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from framework.actions.quality_gates import QualityGatesAction

# Initialize the action
quality_gates = QualityGatesAction()

# Run essential quality checks
result = quality_gates.execute_tier(
    project_dir="/path/to/project",
    tier="essential"
)

if result.success:
    print("‚úÖ All quality gates passed!")
else:
    print(f"‚ùå Quality gates failed: {result.failure_reason}")
    print(f"Details: {result.error_details}")
```

### GitHub Action Usage

```yaml
name: Quality Gates
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality-gates:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Quality Gates
        uses: ./framework/actions/quality-gates
        with:
          tier: essential
          timeout: 300
          parallel: true
```

## Quality Tiers

### Essential Tier (‚â§2 minutes)

The foundational quality gates that **must** pass for any code change.

**Included Checks:**
- ‚úÖ **Unit Tests**: 100% pass rate required
- ‚úÖ **Critical Lint**: F,E9 violations (syntax errors, undefined variables)
- ‚úÖ **Type Checking**: Static type validation

**Performance Requirements:**
- Execution time: ‚â§ 2 minutes
- Zero-tolerance: Any failure stops pipeline immediately
- Coverage requirement: ‚â• 90%

```python
result = quality_gates.execute_tier(
    project_dir=project_path,
    tier="essential",
    timeout=120
)
```

### Extended Tier (‚â§5 minutes)

Additional security and quality checks for enhanced code quality.

**Included Checks:**
- ‚úÖ All Essential tier checks
- ‚úÖ **Security Scanning**: Bandit static analysis

- ‚úÖ **Dead Code Detection**: Unused code identification

**Performance Requirements:**
- Execution time: ‚â§ 5 minutes
- Includes security report generation
- SARIF format for security findings

```python
result = quality_gates.execute_tier(
    project_dir=project_path,
    tier="extended"
)
```

### Full Tier (‚â§10 minutes)

Comprehensive validation with complete reporting for CI/CD pipelines.

**Included Checks:**
- ‚úÖ All Extended tier checks
- ‚úÖ **CI Reporting**: JUnit XML, coverage XML/HTML/JSON

```python
result = quality_gates.execute_tier(
    project_dir=project_path,
    tier="full"
)
```

## Package Manager Support

### Automatic Detection

The Quality Gates Action automatically detects your project's package manager:

```python
manager = quality_gates.detect_package_manager(project_path)
print(f"Detected: {manager.name}")
print(f"Environment support: {manager.environment_support}")
```

            "strict": True,
            "disallow_untyped_defs": True
        }
    }
}

result = quality_gates.execute_tier(
    project_dir=project_path,
    tier="essential",
    config_overrides=custom_config
)
```

## Integration Examples

### Real Project Integration

The Quality Gates Action has been tested and validated against production projects:

#### hb-strategy-sandbox Integration

**Project characteristics:**
- 5,838 Python files across 18,320 total files
- Complex pixi configuration with 10 environments
- Multi-platform support (linux-64, osx-arm64, osx-64, win-64)
- Existing framework/ directory with 53 Python files

**Integration result:**
```python
# Dry-run compatibility test
result = quality_gates.execute_tier(
    project_dir="/path/to/hb-strategy-sandbox",
    tier="essential",
    dry_run=True
)
# ‚úÖ Success: Full compatibility confirmed
```

#### cheap-llm MCP Server Integration

**Project characteristics:**
- Medium-sized MCP server project
- CI-optimized pixi configuration (linux-64 only)
- Tiered quality environments matching our framework
- Uses pyright instead of mypy for type checking

**Integration result:**
```python
# Multi-project compatibility
patterns = quality_gates._detect_project_patterns(cheap_llm_path)
# ‚úÖ Success: Automatic adaptation to different configurations
```

### Drop-in Replacement Testing

For projects with existing framework/ directories:

```python
# Backup existing framework
backup_dir = project_path / "framework_backup"
shutil.copytree(project_path / "framework", backup_dir)

# Test Quality Gates Action compatibility
result = quality_gates.execute_tier(
    project_dir=project_path,
    tier="essential",
    dry_run=True
)

if result.compatibility_check:
    print("‚úÖ Ready for drop-in replacement")
else:
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è  Needs configuration adaptation")
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Benchmarked Performance

Based on real project testing:

| Project Size | Pattern Detection | Dry Run | Full Execution |
|--------------|------------------|---------|----------------|
| Small (<100 files) | <0.1s | <0.5s | <2min |
| Medium (100-1K files) | <0.5s | <1s | <5min |
| Large (1K+ files) | <2s | <5s | <10min |
| Very Large (10K+ files) | <5s | <15s | <20min |

### Parallel vs Sequential

```python
# Sequential execution
result_seq = quality_gates.execute_tier(
    project_dir=project_path,
    tier="essential",
    parallel=False
)

# Parallel execution (default)
result_par = quality_gates.execute_tier(
    project_dir=project_path,
    tier="essential",
    parallel=True
)

# Typical speedup: 1.5x - 3x depending on project
```

### Memory Usage

- Small projects: <10MB memory increase
- Medium projects: <50MB memory increase
- Large projects: <100MB memory increase
- Automatic cleanup on completion

## Error Handling

### Zero-Tolerance Failures

Critical violations that trigger immediate failure:

```python
# F821: Undefined variable
# E999: Syntax error
# Test failures with 0% pass rate
# Missing required dependencies

if not result.success and result.failed_fast:
    print(f"‚ùå Critical failure: {result.failure_reason}")
    print(f"Details: {result.error_details}")
    # Pipeline stops immediately
```

### Graceful Failure Handling

```python
if not result.success and result.partial_success:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  Partial failure: {len(result.successful_checks)} passed")
    print(f"Failed checks: {result.failed_checks}")
    # Some checks passed, others failed
```

### Timeout Handling

```python
if result.failure_reason == "timeout":
    print(f"‚è∞ Execution timed out after {result.timeout_seconds}s")
    # Automatic process cleanup performed
```
