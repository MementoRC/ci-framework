## 🎯 Scenario Selection

Choose your scenario to begin the interactive simulation:

<details>
<summary>🆕 <strong>Scenario A: New Feature Development</strong> (Recommended for beginners)</summary>

### 📋 **Context:**
You're adding a new feature to an existing Python web application. You've made changes to source code, tests, and documentation.

### 📁 **Your Changes:**
```
Modified files:
✏️  src/api/users.py          (added new endpoint)
✏️  src/models/user.py        (added new field)
✏️  tests/test_users.py       (added tests for new endpoint)
✏️  docs/api.md              (updated API documentation)
➕  migrations/002_add_field.py (new database migration)
```

### 🎬 **Let's Start the CI Pipeline...**

---

#### **Step 1: Change Detection** ⏱️ `~10 seconds`

```bash
🔍 Analyzing changes between main...feature-branch
📊 Change Detection Results:
   • Source files: 2 changed
   • Test files: 1 changed  
   • Documentation: 1 changed
   • Database migrations: 1 added
   
⚡ Optimization Analysis:
   • Skip documentation build: ❌ (docs changed)
   • Skip security scan: ❌ (source code changed)
   • Skip full test suite: ❌ (source + tests changed)
   • Optimization score: 15% (still need most checks)
```

**🤔 What This Means:**
Since you changed source code AND tests, the CI system needs to run comprehensive validation. If you had only changed documentation, 75% of the pipeline could be skipped!

**Decision Point:** Should change detection skip any jobs?
- ✅ **No - Run full pipeline** (Recommended for source changes)
- ❌ Skip some jobs (Not safe with source changes)

---

#### **Step 2: Quick Checks** ⏱️ `~45 seconds`

```bash
⚡ Running Essential Quality Gates (Tier 1)
🔍 Critical Error Detection:
   ✅ Syntax validation passed
   ✅ Import checks passed
   ✅ F-level violations: 0 found
   ✅ E9-level violations: 0 found

📝 Code Style Quick Check:
   ⚠️  Found 3 minor style issues in src/api/users.py
   💡 Auto-fixable with: ruff check --fix

🧪 Fast Unit Tests (timeout: 30s):
   ✅ test_user_model: PASSED
   ✅ test_user_endpoint: PASSED  
   ✅ test_new_field_validation: PASSED
   📊 3 tests passed in 8.2s

✅ Quick Checks Result: PASSED
   💡 Minor style issues found but not blocking
```

**🤔 What This Means:**
Essential checks passed! The pipeline can continue. Minor style issues were detected but won't block development - they'll be reported for cleanup.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Quick checks are designed to catch critical errors fast (under 1 minute) so you get immediate feedback.
