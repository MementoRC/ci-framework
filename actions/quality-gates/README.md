# Quality Gates GitHub Action

A comprehensive, tiered quality validation system for Python projects with zero-tolerance policy for critical violations.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```yaml
name: Quality Gates
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality-gates:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Essential Quality Gates
        uses: ./actions/quality-gates
        with:
          tier: essential
```

```yaml
name: Comprehensive Quality Validation
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  essential:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Essential Quality Gates
        uses: ./actions/quality-gates
        with:
          tier: essential
          timeout: 300
          parallel: true
          fail-fast: true

  extended:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: essential
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Extended Quality Gates
        uses: ./actions/quality-gates
        with:
          tier: extended
          timeout: 600
          reports-dir: extended-reports

  full:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: extended
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Full Quality Gates
        uses: ./actions/quality-gates
        with:
          tier: full
          timeout: 900
          config-file: .github/quality-gates.toml
```

## Quality Tiers

### Essential (â‰¤5 minutes)
- Unit tests (100% pass rate)
- Critical lint checks (F,E9 violations)
- Type checking

### Extended (â‰¤10 minutes)
- All essential checks
- Security scanning (Bandit)
- Dependency audit (Safety)
- Code complexity analysis

### Full (â‰¤15 minutes)
- All extended checks
- Complete CI reporting
- Pre-commit hooks
- Build validation

## Configuration

Create `.github/quality-gates.toml`:

```toml
[quality_gates]
timeouts = { test = 120, lint = 60, typecheck = 90 }
thresholds = { coverage = 90, complexity = 10 }

[quality_gates.tools.ruff]
select = ["F", "E9", "W"]
line-length = 88

[quality_gates.tools.mypy]
strict = true
```

## Examples

### Matrix Testing

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
    python-version: ['3.10', '3.11', '3.12']
    tier: [essential, extended]

steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: Quality Gates - ${{ matrix.tier }}
    uses: ./actions/quality-gates
    with:
      tier: ${{ matrix.tier }}
```

### Conditional Execution

```yaml
- name: Full Quality Gates (Main Branch Only)
  uses: ./actions/quality-gates
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  with:
    tier: full
    timeout: 1200
```

### Custom Reports

```yaml
- name: Quality Gates with Custom Reports
  uses: ./actions/quality-gates
  with:
    tier: extended
    reports-dir: custom-reports

- name: Archive Quality Reports
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: quality-reports-${{ github.sha }}
    path: custom-reports/
```

## Integration with Other Actions

- name: Quality Gates Security
  uses: ./actions/quality-gates
  with:
    tier: extended

- name: Upload Security Results
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
  with:
    sarif_file: reports/security.sarif
```

### Coverage Reports
