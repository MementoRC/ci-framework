A GitHub Action that automatically removes development files from main branches when pull requests are merged, while preserving them in feature branches for developer productivity.

## 🚨 Quality Gates - Zero CI Failures

**Before committing, ALWAYS run:**
```bash
pixi run quality    # Tests + lint + typecheck - must pass
```

**If you get lint errors in CI:**
```bash
pixi run emergency-fix               # Quick fix: lint-fix + format + test
# OR
./scripts/fix-lint-violations.sh    # Guided emergency fix script
```

**Full quality workflow:**
```bash
pixi run quality           # Full quality check
pixi run lint-fix          # Auto-fix lint issues  
pixi run format            # Format code
git add . && git commit    # Pre-commit hooks run automatically
```

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Ever accidentally merged development configuration files like `.claude`, `.mcp.json`, `.taskmaster`, or `.cursor` into your main branch? This action prevents that by automatically cleaning up these files after PR merges, keeping your production branches clean while maintaining developer workflow flexibility.

## ✨ Features

- 🔧 **Preserves dev files in feature branches** - Developers can use AI tools and configs freely
- 🧹 **Auto-cleanup on main branch merges** - Removes dev files only when merging to production branches
- 📝 **Comprehensive file handling** - Handles AI tools, editor configs, temp files, and OS artifacts
- 🎯 **Smart operation** - Only commits when files are actually removed
- 💬 **PR feedback** - Optional comment confirming cleanup completion
- 🔧 **Customizable patterns** - Add project-specific files to cleanup
- 📊 **Action outputs** - Reports number of files removed and cleanup status

## 🚀 Quick Start
