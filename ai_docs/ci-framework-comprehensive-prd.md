### **Drop-in Usage Modes**

#### **Mode 1: Pure Local CI** (No GitHub Actions)
```bash
# Drop framework into any repository
git clone https://github.com/MementoRC/ci-framework.git ci-framework/
./ci-framework/scripts/setup-local-ci.sh

# Immediate local CI capabilities
pixi run quality                                    # Uses framework configs
./ci-framework/scripts/local-quality-gates.sh --tier=extended
./ci-framework/scripts/selective-ci.sh --package=auto-detect
```

#### **Mode 2: Monorepo Integration** (Package-aware CI)
```bash
# Auto-detect monorepo structure
./ci-framework/scripts/package-detection.py --scan --configure

# Package-specific CI
./ci-framework/scripts/selective-ci.sh --package=candles-feed --tier=essential
./ci-framework/scripts/selective-ci.sh --changed-only --since=main --tier=extended

# Cross-package dependency analysis
./ci-framework/scripts/monorepo-ci.sh --analyze-dependencies --package=strategy-sandbox
```

#### **Mode 3: Hybrid Local + Remote** (Best of both worlds)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Hybrid CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  local-quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Local Quality Gates
        run: ./ci-framework/scripts/local-quality-gates.sh --tier=extended

  remote-security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Security Scan
        uses: MementoRC/ci-framework/actions/security-scan@v2
```

### **Core Components Deep Dive**

#### **1. Quality Gates Action** (`actions/quality-gates/`)
**Purpose**: Centralized implementation of the proven 3-tier quality system

**Capabilities**:
- **Tier 1 (Essential)**: pytest, ruff, pyright - Zero tolerance enforcement
- **Tier 2 (Extended)**: bandit, safety, pre-commit - Security and compliance
- **Tier 3 (CI/CD)**: build, coverage, reporting - Deployment readiness

**Configuration**:
```yaml
- name: Quality Gates
  uses: MementoRC/ci-framework/actions/quality-gates@v2
  with:
    tier: "extended"                    # essential, extended, full
    python-version: "3.10"
    fail-fast: true
    coverage-threshold: 90
    security-level: "high"
```

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Extract common quality logic from hb-strategy-sandbox and cheap-llm
- Implement tiered execution based on pyproject.toml configurations
- Support both pixi and traditional pip environments
- Generate standardized quality reports

#### **2. Security Scan Action** (`actions/security-scan/`)
**Purpose**: Unified security scanning across all projects

**Capabilities**:
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: bandit, safety, pip-audit integration
- **Container Security**: Trivy scanning with SBOM generation
- **Secrets Detection**: Advanced pattern matching
- **Compliance Reporting**: SARIF output for GitHub Security tab

**Configuration**:
```yaml
- name: Security Scan
  uses: MementoRC/ci-framework/actions/security-scan@v2
  with:
    scan-containers: true
    generate-sbom: true
    security-level: "high"              # low, medium, high, critical
    upload-sarif: true
```

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Consolidate security patterns from hb-strategy-sandbox

    regression-threshold: "10%"
    compare-with: "main"
    store-results: true
```

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Extract performance monitoring from hb-strategy-sandbox
- Implement statistical regression analysis
- Support multiple benchmark frameworks
- Generate trend reports and alerts

#### **4. Change Detection Action** (`actions/change-detection/`)
**Purpose**: Intelligent CI optimization based on change analysis

**Capabilities**:
- **Smart Job Triggering**: Skip unnecessary jobs based on changes
- **Dependency Analysis**: Understand impact of changes
- **Test Optimization**: Run only affected test suites
- **Documentation Detection**: Separate docs-only changes

**Configuration**:
```yaml
- name: Change Detection
  uses: MementoRC/ci-framework/actions/change-detection@v2
  with:
    analyze-dependencies: true
    optimize-tests: true
    docs-patterns: "docs/**,*.md,*.rst"
